InvasiveApp is a satirical webpage targeting the youth's reliable hyping of the revolving door of "next-big-thing" apps. From Myspace to Vine, and from kik to Snapchat, these are gimmicky, flash-in-the-pan programs that charm millions of adolescents at once, but lack any staying power. InvasiveApp is no different, and makes little effort to hide its true cash-grabbing motivations---what the developers really want is to sell your personal data! Asking for things like your name, location, phone number, email, as well as logging pictures of your likeness, InvasiveApp has no qualms about selling this information to the highest bidder---and it's all outlined in the terms and conditions (which you thoroughly studied, right?). So long as it's popular, even a name as unsavory and transparent as InvasiveApp won't stop the general population from scratching its collective FOMO-itch.
